# HW-flashcard-generator
UCLA Homework Week 11

This is a nodejs app, run from the command line.  It allows a user to create 2 different types of flashcards.  It uses inquirer to get user input, and you can make a basic question and answer or cloze flashcard.  A cloze flashcard is a fill in the blank instead of asking a question.  The instructions were a bit confusing, and it was unclear if there needed to be a function to run the user through their made flashcards or if that was a bonus. I was unable to get this part working before it was due. When I would try to get the user made flashcards from the .txt file it would always reutrn undefined, or throw an error.
